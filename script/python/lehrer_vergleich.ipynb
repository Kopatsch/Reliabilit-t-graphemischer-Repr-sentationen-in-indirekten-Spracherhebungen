    "## Jupyter Notebook zur Erstellung des Lehrer-Subsets\n",
    "\n",
    "Die Fragebögen aus den Maurer- und DWA- Befragungen wurden an Lehrkräfte im Zielgebiet verschickt. Gegeben der kurzen Zeitspanne zwischen den Untersuchungen und der Vielzahl der Fragebögen, liegt die Vermutung nahe, dass einige Lehrkräfte an beiden Befragungen teilgenommen haben. Es soll geprüft werden, ob die sich die Variablität zwischen den Befragungen verringert, wenn die selbe Person die Bögen beantwortet hat (Varianzreduktion in Bezug auf persönlich Schreibpräferenz, Angewohnheiten etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Uns liegt eine Tabelle vor, in der für jeden Befragungsort geschaut wurde, ob die Lehrkraft übereinstimmt oder nicht. Dabei ist zu beachten, dass lediglich die transkribierten Lehrernamen aus der DWA Befragung vorliegen. Die Lehrernamen der Maurerbefragung wurden bis jetzt noch nicht transliteriert. Außerdem werden Mehrfachnennungen von Lehrkräften in einem Bogen in der Tabelle auf mehrere Spalten aufgeteilt. Das führt dazu, dass die Fragebögen (sowohl DWA als auch Maurer) oft mehrfach in der Tabelle vorkommen und die Orte entsprechend auch mehrfach vorkommen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Um diese Informationen sinnvoll nutzen zu können, muss ein Subset des Datensatzes erstellt werden. Dieses Subset soll lediglich die Orte enthalten, an denen eine Übereinstimmung der Lehrkraft vorliegt. Deshalb wird zunächst die Lehrertabelle eingelesen, um Nicht-Übereinstimmungen bereinigt und zu Letzt um die Worte aus dem Fragebögen ergänzt. Auf dieser Basis werden wieder Levenshtein Distanzen berechnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vermutlich gäbe es einen effizienteren Weg, diese Aufgabe zu lösen, als hier geschehen."
